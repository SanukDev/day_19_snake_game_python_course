Snake Game in Python

This repository contains the Python code for a classic Snake game, implemented using the Turtle graphics library.

Features:

Smooth snake movement with keyboard controls (Up, Down, Left, Right)
Food generation at random locations
Scorekeeping that updates with each eaten food item
Game over detection upon collision with walls or the snake's own body
Clear visual representation of the game elements (snake, food, score)

Requirements:

Python 3 (tested with version 3.x)
Turtle graphics library (usually included in standard Python installations)

Gameplay:

Once the game starts, use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the movement of the snake.
The objective is to collect as much food as possible while avoiding collisions with the walls or your own snake body.
Each eaten food item increases your score, which is displayed on the screen.
The game ends if the snake collides with a wall or its own body.
Code Structure:

snake.py: Contains the main game logic, including snake movement, collision detection, scorekeeping, and screen updates.
food.py: Defines the Food class responsible for generating random food positions on the screen.
scoreboard.py: Implements the Scoreboard class, which manages the game score and displays it on the screen.
Additional Notes:

You can customize the game parameters (e.g., screen size, snake speed) by modifying the code within snake.py.
Feel free to experiment with different visual elements and game mechanics to enhance the gameplay experience.
